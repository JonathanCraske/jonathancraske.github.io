## Sports & Recreation
As a devotee of many Canadian stereotypes, I am an avid hockey fan. I grew up playing the sport competitively, and continue to play for fun whenever possible. I follow professional hockey closely, and am a long-suffering supporter of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

I also enjoy long-distance running, and have completed several races during my PhD including a 24-hour marathon, several half-marathons, and The Speed Project in 2024 - an unsanctioned relay race from the Santa Monica Pier to Las Vegas.


## Music
I am extremely passionate about music. I grew up playing several instruments including saxophone and guitar, and previously served on the board of directors for Wavelength - Toronto's longest running independent music festival. I have enjoyed exceptional live-music scene in LA and continue to grow my record collection (which currently stands at more than 225).


## Cooking & Food
Food has always been, and continues to be, a big part of my life. I love to cook and bake whenever I have the opportunity. While in LA, I primarily relied on the city's exceptional street-food culture as a means through which to explore. Specifically, I rely on cheeseburgers to guide me anytime I visit a new city - recommendations are always welcome!
