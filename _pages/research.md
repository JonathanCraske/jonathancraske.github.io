My research focuses on information and contracting dynamics. More specifically, I am interested in: emergent trends in open and alternative data; financial regulation and public policy; and governance.

### Banking on Lenders: Delegated Monitoring at the Debt-Equity Interface
with [KR Subramanyam](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/personnel/kr-subramanyam) - *Under Review at the Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis*

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  <em>We investigate whether lender monitoring serves as a substitute for equity blockholder monitoring. While active equity blockholders engage in direct monitoring, passive equity blockholders (PEBs) do not. Because private lenders are well positioned to serve as effective monitoring agents, we posit that their presence will attract passive blockholders who can rely on lender monitoring efforts. Using syndicated loans to capture firms’ exposure to lender monitoring, we find that the presence of syndicated loans is positively associated with passive blockholder interest in the cross-section. We also find that the issuance of new loans is followed by increases in passive blockholders. Consistent with our conjectures, we show that the extent of association between loans and passive blockholders is increasing in the monitoring incentives and capabilities of lenders and decreasing in the agency conflicts between lenders and equity holders. Overall, we show that equity blockholders rely on active lenders for their monitoring needs.</em>

### "Capitol Markets": The Effects of Congressional Stock Trades
with [Maria Khrakovsky](https://sites.google.com/view/maria-khrakovsky) - *Preparing for Submission*

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
  <em>Congressional stock trading and its potential for the use of private information for personal gain have been a long-debated topic in the U.S. In 2012, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act was passed, explicitly forbidding insider trading by Congresspeople and requiring timely public disclosure of all trades. We examine the market response to these disclosures and find evidence of a significant reaction based on abnormal returns, abnormal volume, and abnormal volatility measures. This reaction indicates that the market views these trades as informed despite recent findings that, since the enactment of the STOCK Act, Congressional trades do not achieve superior returns. We identify several characteristics of trades and disclosures that elicit a greater market reaction, including trades made in smaller market-cap and highly regulated firms, more timely public disclosures of trades, and trades that may represent a potential conflict of interest based on committee membership. Further, we find evidence of spillover effects to competitor peers of the focal (i.e., traded) firm. This evidence is suggestive of the market’s interpretation of the Congressperson’s private information as industry-specific, and not firm-specific.</em>
