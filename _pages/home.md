Prior to pursuing a career in academia, I worked as a Forensic Data Analytics consultant at KPMG LLP in Toronto. I received my CPA, CA designation after achieving National Honour Roll status in my common final examination (2016 - top 1% of national CPA exam writers). Click for my [CV](/cv/).

Outside of accounting and academia, my interests include cooking, ice hockey, running, collecting and listening to vinyl records, and live music.
